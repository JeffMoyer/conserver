				=============

This is the Conserver FAQ.  Any suggestions/corrections/etc should be
directed to faq@conserver.com.  The FAQ answers the following questions:

    1) What is conserver?
    2) Where can I find the software?
    3) How do I deal with these serial ports?
    4) How can I tell what compile-time defaults were used?
    5) What does "conserver: getservbyname: conserver: No such file or
       directory" mean (or something close to that)?
    6) What does "console: gethostbyname: console: host lookup error"
       mean (or something close to that)?
    7) How do I set up a serial port for no parity?
   99) Ok, things just don't seem to work.  Help?!?


 1) What is conserver?

    From an email I quickly wrote to a potential user (I'll try and
    clean it up and make it a little clearer sometime soon):

    Conserver is an application that allows multiple users to watch a
    serial console at the same time.  It can log the data, allows users
    to take write-access of a console (one at a time), and has a
    variety of bells and whistles to accentuate that basic
    functionality.  The idea is that conserver will log all your serial
    traffic so you can go back and review why something crashed, look
    at changes (if done on the console), or tie the console logs into a
    monitoring system (just watch the logfiles it creates).  With
    multi-user capabilities you can work on equipment with others,
    mentor, train, etc.  It also does all that client-server stuff so
    that, assuming you have a network connection, you can interact with
    any of the equipment from home or wherever.

 2) Where can I find the software?

    The latest version can be found at http://www.conserver.com/

 3) How do I wire/hook up serial ports?

    David "Zonker" Harris has a wonderful set of pages that talk about
    hooking up many types of terminal servers, equipment, etc.  It also
    provides links to other serial port references.  You can find his
    pages at http://www.conserver.com/consoles/.

    Celeste Stokely also has a wealth of references at
    http://www.stokely.com/.  Just look around and be amazed at what
    you'll find!

 4) How can I tell what compile-time defaults were used?

    The compile-time defaults can be found by running conserver and
    console with the -V flag.  Simple as that.

 5) What does "conserver: getservbyname: conserver: No such file or
    directory" mean (or something close to that)?

    When conserver was compiled, it was told to use the /etc/services
    entry of "conserver" (what came after getservbyname:).  You'll need
    to either recompile conserver and hard-code a port number (using
    PORT instead of SERVICE in conserver/cons.h) or enter "conserver"
    in /etc/services.

 6) What does "console: gethostbyname: console: host lookup error"
    mean (or something close to that)?

    When the console command was compiled, it was told to use the
    hostname "console" (what came after gethostbyname:) as the master
    conserver host.  You'll need to either recompile console with the
    appropriate name of your conserver host or add an alias of "console".
    In most cases, adding an alias is my suggestion.

 7) How do I set up a local serial port for no parity?

    The conserver.cf man page will have this in the 6.17 release,
    but the answer is to use a 'p' after the baud rate.  So, '9600p'
    is 9600 baud, no parity.

99) Ok, things just don't seem to work.  Help?!?

    Yes, this is a pretty vague question, but here are a few tips that
    might help.

    - Is your low-level serial connection correct?  Incorrect cables,
      adapters, wiring, etc. could be the issue.  Using a signal tracer
      or attaching other equipment that's known to work (like a laptop)
      might be enlightening.  Check out
      http://www.conserver.com/consoles/msock.html for basic serial
      information (or http://www.conserver.com/consoles/ for even more
      info).

    - Can you talk to the serial port with different software?  Try
      using tip or minicom or another application to make sure you can
      interact with the port.  If you're not seeing the right info
      here, there may be a baud rate issue, a lack of a getty (or
      equivalent) running on the host or...*shrug*.  But, if you've
      determined that you already have a valid low-level signal
      connection, you shouldn't have to worry about that level of
      problem.

    - So, you're getting the proper interaction from other
      applications, but not conserver?  Are the port name and baud rate
      correct in the conserver.cf file?  When you start conserver
      (adding -v doesn't hurt), are there any warnings/errors?  Is the
      port in the "up" state when you use "console -u"?  If not, what
      happens when you connect and then do a "^eco" escape sequence to
      bring it up?  What does the conserver process say when you do
      this?  These are the types of things I look at first.  If that
      doesn't help you determine the problem, others will want to see
      this info (and possibly the same steps with both the client and
      server using the -D option) to be able to help.  Posting your
      questions to the users mailing list is probably your next step.

    - Have you tried a search on the conserver site (it searches
      mailing list traffic as well) to see if someone else has gone
      through the same problem?
