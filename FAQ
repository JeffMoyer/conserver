				=============

This is the Conserver FAQ.  Any suggestions/corrections/etc should be
directed to faq@conserver.com.  The FAQ answers the following questions:

    1) Where can I find the software?
    2) How do I deal with these serial ports?
    3) How can I tell what compile-time defaults were used?
    4) What does "conserver: getservbyname: conserver: No such file or
       directory" mean (or something close to that)?
    5) What does "console: gethostbyname: console: host lookup error"
       mean (or something close to that)?
    6) How do I set up a serial port for no parity?


 1) Where can I find the software?

    The latest version can be found at http://www.conserver.com/

 2) How do I wire/hook up serial ports?

    David "Zonker" Harris has a wonderful set of pages that talk about
    hooking up many types of terminal servers, equipment, etc.  It also
    provides links to other serial port references.  You can find his
    pages at http://www.conserver.com/consoles/.

    Celeste Stokely also has a wealth of references at
    http://www.stokely.com/.  Just look around and be amazed at what
    you'll find!

 3) How can I tell what compile-time defaults were used?

    The compile-time defaults can be found by running conserver and
    console with the -V flag.  Simple as that.

 4) What does "conserver: getservbyname: conserver: No such file or
    directory" mean (or something close to that)?

    When conserver was compiled, it was told to use the /etc/services
    entry of "conserver" (what came after getservbyname:).  You'll need
    to either recompile conserver and hard-code a port number (using
    PORT instead of SERVICE in conserver/cons.h) or enter "conserver"
    in /etc/services.

 5) What does "console: gethostbyname: console: host lookup error"
    mean (or something close to that)?

    When the console command was compiled, it was told to use the
    hostname "console" (what came after gethostbyname:) as the master
    conserver host.  You'll need to either recompile console with the
    appropriate name of your conserver host or add an alias of "console".
    In most cases, adding an alias is my suggestion.

 6) How do I set up a local serial port for no parity?

    The conserver.cf man page will have this in the 6.17 release,
    but the answer is to use a 'p' after the baud rate.  So, '9600p'
    is 9600 baud, no parity.
