Upgrading?

    Whenever you upgrade I suggest you upgrade both the client and
    server.  Most times, however, you can get away without upgrading
    the client (it's usually a fairly static piece of code).  I'll
    document any dependencies here, but check the CHANGES file for any
    new features added to the client if you're considering *not*
    upgrading.

    Version 7.1.0

	- The client/server protocol has changed.  You *MUST* use a
	  7.1.0 client with a 7.1.0 and above server.  A 7.1.0 client
	  is *not* backward compatible with a pre-7.1.0 server.

	- Some of the flags in the client (-d, -D, and -r) and server
	  (-n) have been given new identities to make the client and
	  server flags more uniform.

	- The conserver.passwd file now uses the first username match
	  to determine access rights - if you have multiple instances
	  of a username in an existing password file, they must be
	  combined into one to continue to work.


Quickie Instructions

    - Download conserver (http://www.conserver.com/) and unpack

    - Run './configure'

    - If all is well, run 'make install'

    - Now set up config files, etc. (see below)


Detailed Instructions

    - First thing to do is determine if you want different defaults.  A
      './configure --help' will show you the basics.  If you like all
      the defaults shown, you're set.  If not, here are the conserver
      unique options:

	--with-port=PORT        Specify port number [conserver]
	--with-base=PORT        Base port for secondary channel [0]
	--with-master=MASTER    Specify master server hostname [console]
	--with-cffile=CFFILE    Specify config filename [conserver.cf]
	--with-pwdfile=PWDFILE  Specify password filename [conserver.passwd]
	--with-logfile=LOGFILE  Specify log filename [/var/log/conserver]
	--with-pidfile=PIDFILE  Specify PID filepath [/var/run/conserver.pid]
	--with-maxmemb=MAXMEMB  Specify maximum consoles per process [16]
	--with-maxgrp=MAXGRP    Specify maximum number of processes [32]
	--with-timeout=TIMEOUT  Specify connect() timeout in seconds [10]

      Not surprisingly, some match the old conserver/cons.h items...here
      they are for reference:

	PORT or SERVICE		- Socket used to communicate
	HOST			- Hostname of console server
	CONFIG			- Config file path
	PASSWD_FILE		- Password file path
	MAXMEMB			- Number of consoles per child process
	MAXGRP			- Number of child processes

    - Run './configure'.  This will detect system specific
      information.  The --prefix option will redirect where things are
      installed.  Other options are available as well...try
      './configure --help'.

    - Now run 'make'.  Hopefully things will compile.

    - Once things build, you can run 'make install'.

    - If you'd like to build the autologin application, you'll need to
      run 'make autologin'.  If you'd like it installed, use 'make
      autologin.install'.

    - Now that the binaries are in place, we need to set up the
      configuration files and such.

      + Does your conserver master hostname exist?  This is the
	hostname specified with the --with-master option.  By default
	the hostname is "console", so make sure it's in DNS, hosts
	files, or whatever.

      + If you used a symbolic name for the --with-port option (by
	default it uses "conserver", so the answer would be yes),
	you'll need to enter a definition in your services file
	(directly, via NIS, or whatever).  Here's what we use:

	    console      782/tcp    conserver    # console server

	If you used a number, you shouldn't have to worry about this
	step.

      + Next, make sure conserver runs during boot.  The init script we
	use under Solaris is installed in <PREFIX>/etc/conserver.rc.
	Use that or some form of it for your own /etc/init.d script or
	an entry in startup files (/etc/rc, /etc/rc.local, or
	whatever).

      + Now for the fun stuff.  You need to create a conserver.cf and
	conserver.passwd file.  Those are defined with the
	--with-cffile and --with-pwdfile settings.  If you ever need to
	know what values were compiled into conserver, run 'conserver
	-V'.  See the conserver.cf/INSTALL file for instructions on
	setup of these files.

    - That's it!  Just start up the console server and enjoy!
