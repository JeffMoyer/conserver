				INSTALL
				=======

Quickie Instructions

	- Edit 'conserver/cons.h' (if necessary)

	- Run 'make'

	- If all is well, run 'make install install.man'

	- Now set up config files, etc. (see below)

    Things will install in /usr/local.  If you'd like to use a different
    prefix, use 'make PREFIX=/your/path install'.


Detailed Instructions

    - First thing to do is set up a custom conserver/cons.h file.  If you
      like all the defaults provided in conserver/port.h, your set.
      Just use the default cons.h cons.h file.  Here are some of the
      more important #defines to look for:

	PORT or SERVICE		- Socket used to communicate
	HOST			- Hostname of console server
	CONFIG			- Config file path
	PASSWD_FILE		- Password file path
	MAXMEMB			- Number of consoles per child process
	MAXGRP			- Number of child processes

    - Now run 'make'.  If you're platform is supported you'll get a nice
      message about "Configuring for ..." and the programs should compile.
      If not, you'll have to adjust the settings, or slightly worse,
      port the software.  For adjusting the settings (like using a
      different compiler or something), check out the .settings file.
      'make config', which is done for you, symlinks it to port/<ostype>.
      If you have to port the software, follow the instructions you
      received.

    - Once things build, you can run 'make install install.man'.
      This will put things into the /usr/local tree.  If you'd like
      things deposited elsewhere, you can use 'make PREFIX=/your/path
      install install.man'.  We like to use something like 'make
      PREFIX=/tools/conserver install install.man'.

    - Now that the binaries are in place, we need to set up the
      configuration files and such.

      If you used a blank cons.h file or defined a service name (SERVICE
      token above), you'll need to enter a definition in your services
      file (directly, via NIS, or whatever).  Here's what we use:

	    console      782/tcp      conserver    # console server

      If you defined PORT, you shouldn't have to worry about this step.

      Next, make sure conserver runs during boot.  The init script
      we use under Solaris is installed in <PREFIX>/etc/conserver.rc.
      Use that or some form of it for your own /etc/init.d script or an
      entry in startup files (/etc/rc, /etc/rc.local, or whatever).

      Now for the fun stuff.  You need to create a conserver.cf and
      conserver.passwd file.  Those are defined with the CONFIG and
      PASSWD_FILE settings.  If you ever need to know what values
      were compiled into conserver, run 'conserver -V'.  See the
      conserver.cf/INSTALL file for instructions on setup of these files.

    - That's it!  Just start up the console server and enjoy!
