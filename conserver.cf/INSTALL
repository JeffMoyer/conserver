The two files you need to set up are the conserver.cf and conserver.passwd
files.  See the sample conserver.cf and conserver.passwd files
for examples.  You can start with those and then modify extensively.
The man page for conserver.cf should explain that file with enough detail
to get you going.

As for the conserver.passwd file, here are some instructions.  The file
contains three fields seperated by colons: <username>:<passwd>:<hosts>.
The <passwd> field should either be an encrypted password or the special
string '*passwd*', which will cause the console server to do a getpwnam()
call.  The <hosts> field can be a comma seperated list of console names
(from conserver.cf) or the special string 'any'.  Access for the user
is only granted to the hosts listed here (or all if 'any' is used).

That's about it.  Good luck.
