The two files you need to set up are the conserver.cf and conserver.passwd
files.  See the sample conserver.cf and conserver.passwd files
for examples.  You can start with those and then modify extensively.
The man page for conserver.cf and conserver.passwd should explain the
files with enough detail to get you going.

That's about it.  Good luck.
