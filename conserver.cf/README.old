This configuration file has been extended from the Ohio State version.  We
allow parity and baud to be set, as well as more than one console server
machine to be in play at a time.  We have too many console servers to use
just a single Sun3... :-).


We also allow another section for trusted hosts.  We allow our operators root
access by physical access to a workstation.
