# 1. change the `/dev/ttya' to any tty device you can put a serial device on
#    that you could talk to with kermit/cu.  Put in the baud rate and parity.
#
# 2. change the `cc.purdue.edu' to your local domain.
#
# 3. !! do not leave this up, as it can give local users a root shell (login)
#    !! for extended testing change the `|' to `|su - tst' where tst is a
#    !! vanilla test acount, or comment out the `login' console.
