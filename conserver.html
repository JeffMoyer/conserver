        <P>From an email I once sent...</P>

        <P>Conserver is an application that allows multiple users
        to watch a serial console at the same time. It can log the
        data, allows users to take write-access of a console (one
        at a time), and has a variety of bells and whistles to
        accentuate that basic functionality. The idea is that
        conserver will log all your serial traffic so you can go
        back and review why something crashed, look at changes (if
        done on the console), or tie the console logs into a
        monitoring system (just watch the logfiles it creates).
        With multi-user capabilities you can work on equipment with
        others, mentor, train, etc. It also does all that
        client-server stuff so that, assuming you have a network
        connection, you can interact with any of the equipment from
        home or wherever.</P>

        <H3>The FAQ</H3>Here's the conserver <A href="FAQ">FAQ</A>.
        Got any additions? Let me know.

        <H3>Mailing Lists</H3>

        <P>There are currently two mailing lists available.
        <A href="mailto:announce@conserver.com">announce@conserver.com</A>
        is an announcement-only mailing list for informing of new
        versions, major developments, etc. <A href=
        "mailto:users@conserver.com">users@conserver.com</A> is for
        general Q&amp;A, discussions, ideas, etc. for conserver
        users. You can sign up by sending a message to <A href=
        "mailto:announce-request@conserver.com">announce-request@conserver.com</A>
        or <A href=
        "mailto:users-request@conserver.com">users-request@conserver.com</A>
        with a subject of "subscribe" or head over to the online
        <A href="https://www.conserver.com/mailman/listinfo">web
        pages</A>.</P>

        <H3>Origin</H3>

        <P>The console server software found here is a heavily
        modified version originally written by <A href=
        "http://hea-www.harvard.edu/~fine/">Tom Fine</A> (<A href=
        "mailto:fine@head-cfa.harvard.edu">fine@head-cfa.harvard.edu</A>)
        at <A href="http://www.ohio-state.edu/">Ohio State</A> and
        then Kevin S Braunsdorf (<A href=
        "mailto:ksb+conserver@sa.fedex.com">ksb+conserver@sa.fedex.com</A>)
        at <A href="http://www.purdue.edu/">Purdue University</A>.
        Patches from Robert Olson (<A href=
        "mailto:olson@mcs.anl.gov">olson@mcs.anl.gov</A>) at
        <A href="http://www.anl.gov/">Argonne National
        Laboratory</A> were then applied to get network console
        support.</P>

        <P>Arnold de Leon (<A href=
        "mailto:arnold@corp.webtv.net">arnold@corp.webtv.net</A>)
        then fixed various bugs and added enhancements while at
        <A href="http://www.synopsys.com/">Synopsys</A>. I then
        took the result, continued fixing things, and added
        features we found useful.</P>

        <P><A href="http://www.gnac.com/">GNAC</A> (Global
        Networking and Computing - currently <A href=
        "http://www.certaintysolutions.com/">Certainty
        Solutions</A>) has been supporting my coding efforts (in
        too many ways to list) since 1996.</P>

        <H3>The conserver.com Distribution</H3>

        <P>The result is a combination of many people's work. This
        version is being released in hopes that it will help
        others. There is no warranty or support implied by the
        distribution of the software.</P>

        <P>So, what the heck is up with all the different conserver
        versions? Well, the original authors are continuing to
        distribute their own threads of the software so you have
        three main threads (as far as I know). First, there's Tom
        Fine's thread at <A href=
        "http://hea-www.harvard.edu/~fine/Tech/console-server.html">
        http://hea-www.harvard.edu/~fine/Tech/console-server.html</A>.
        He isn't actively developing it, however, according to the
        website. Next, there's Kevin Braunsdorf's version at
        <A href=
        "http://www.npcguild.org/software/pundits/">http://www.npcguild.org/software/pundits/</A>.
        It doesn't look like Kevin is working on his thread ony
        more either. No new versions have been out since August
        2000 (version 8.5), but maybe this info will be out of date
        by the time you read this (I last checked Feb 10, 2004).
        Lastly, the conserver.com version is based on Kevin's
        "5.21-Beta" distribution, but since <B>HEAVILY</B> modified
        and enhanced (more details in the "Origin" section
        above).</P>

        <P>If I were looking for a conserver package I would
        definitely use the conserver.com distribution. Why? It's
        actively maintained, has many more features than the other
        versions (see <A href="CHANGES">CHANGES</A> for a
        semi-scary history), and has an active user community.
        Kevin's version does have UPS support (basic serial port
        line toggling bits) which is missing in the conserver.com
        version, but no one has asked me for it, so does anyone
        actually need it?</P>

        <H3>Downloading</H3>

        <P>The current version, released on Apr 4, 2014, is
        <A href="8.1.20.tar.gz">8.1.20.tar.gz</A>. See the <A href=
        "CHANGES">CHANGES</A> file for information on the latest
        updates.</P>

        <P>For those worried about legal issues, the <A href=
        "LICENSE">LICENSE</A> file should help show it's
        distributed under a <A href=
        "http://www.opensource.org/licenses/bsd-license.php">BSD
        license.</A></P>

        <P>As of version 6.1.7, the packaging and numbering scheme
        has changed. I used to package conserver as
        conserver-GNAC-v.vv. Since <A href=
        "http://www.gnac.com/">GNAC</A> (now <A href=
        "http://www.certaintysolutions.com/">Certainty
        Solutions</A>) has changed its name I've decided to drop
        the GNAC portion and use a three-digit version number
        (conserver-v.v.v). Why change the version numbering? I need
        to differentiate this thread of the code from the original
        authors' and I couldn't come up with a good replacement for
        the GNAC name - sad, but true.</P>

        <H3>Installation</H3>

        <P>Check the <A href="INSTALL">INSTALL</A> file for
        instructions.</P>

        <H3>Online Documentation</H3>

        <P>I've put a small set of documentation <A href=
        "docs/">here</A>. I'm hoping to expand it over time.</P>

        <H3>Systems Tested</H3>

        <P>Here's a list of systems that I've been told can
        successfully compile conserver. If anyone has more to add
        to this list (or something on the list doesn't work any
        more), please let me know.</P>
