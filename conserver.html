Conserver is an application that allows multiple users to watch a
serial console at the same time.  It can log the data, allows users to
take write-access of a console (one at a time), and has a variety of
bells and whistles to accentuate that basic functionality.  The idea is
that conserver will log all your serial traffic so you can go back and
review why something crashed, look at changes (if done on the console),
or tie the console logs into a monitoring system (just watch the
logfiles it creates).  With multi-user capabilities you can work on
equipment with others, mentor, train, etc.  It also does all that
client-server stuff so that, assuming you have a network connection,
you can interact with any of the equipment from home or wherever.

<H3>A FAQ!</H3>

Here's the start of a conserver <A
HREF="http://www.conserver.com/FAQ">FAQ</A>.  Got any additions?  Let
me know.

<H3>Mailing Lists</H3>
<P>

There are currently two mailing lists available.  <A
HREF="mailto:announce@conserver.com">announce@conserver.com</A> is an
announcement-only mailing list for informing of new versions, major
developments, etc.  <A
HREF="mailto:users@conserver.com">users@conserver.com</A> is for
general Q&amp;A, discussions, ideas, etc for conserver users.  You can
sign up my sending a message to <A
HREF="mailto:announce-request@conserver.com">announce-request@conserver.com</A>
or <A
HREF="mailto:users-request@conserver.com">users-request@conserver.com</A>

<H3>Origin</H3>
<P>

The console server software found here is a heavily modified version
originally written by <A HREF="http://hea-www.harvard.edu/~fine/">Tom
Fine</A> (<A
HREF="mailto:fine@head-cfa.harvard.edu">fine@head-cfa.harvard.edu</A>)
at Ohio State and then Kevin S Braunsdorf (<A
HREF="mailto:ksb+conserver@sa.fedex.com">ksb+conserver@sa.fedex.com</A>).
Patches from Robert Olson (<A
HREF="mailto:olson@mcs.anl.gov">olson@mcs.anl.gov</A>) were then
applied to get network console support.

</P>
<P>

Arnold de Leon (<A
HREF="mailto:arnold@corp.webtv.net">arnold@corp.webtv.net</A>) then
fixed various bugs and added enhancements while at <A
HREF="http://www.synopsys.com/">Synopsys</A>.  I then took the result,
continued fixing things, and added features we found useful.

</P>
<P>

<A HREF="http://www.certaintysolutions.com/">Certainty Solutions</A>
(formerly Global Networking and Computing - GNAC) has been supporting
my coding efforts (in too many ways to list) since 1996.

</P>

<H3>The conserver.com Distribution</H3>

<P>
The result is a combination of many people's work.  This version is
being released in hopes that it will help others.  There is no warranty
or support implied by the distribution of the software.
</P>

<P>
As of version 6.1.7, the packaging and numbering scheme has changed.  I
used to package conserver as conserver-GNAC-v.vv.  Since GNAC (now <A
HREF="http://www.certaintysolutions.com/">Certainty Solutions</A>) has
changed it's name I've decided to drop the GNAC portion and use a 3
digit version number (conserver-v.v.v).  Why change the version
numbering?  I need to differentiate this thread of the code from the
original authors and I couldn't come up with a good replacement for the
GNAC name - sad, but true.
</P>

<P>
Zonker Harris has fabulous documents regarding the hookup of
consoles to terminal servers and other such devices.  His <A
