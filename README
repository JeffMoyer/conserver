Origin

    The console server software found here is a heavily modified version
    originally written by Tom Fine (fine@cis.ohio-state.edu) and then
    Kevin S Braunsdorf (ksb@cc.purdue.edu).  Patches from Robert Olson
    (olson@mcs.anl.gov) were then applied to get network console support.

    Arnold de Leon (arnold@corp.webtv.net) then fixed various bugs and
    added enhancements while at Synopsys.  I then took the result and
    continued fixing things and adding features we found useful.


The GNAC Version

    The result is a combination of many people's work.  We (GNAC)
    are releasing this combination in hopes that it will help others.
    There is no warranty or support implied by our distribution of
    the software.


Downloading

    The latest version can be found at ftp://ftp.gnac.com/pub/conserver/.

Installation

    Quickie instructions:

	    Edit 'conserver/cons.h'

	    Run 'make config'

	    Run 'make'

	    If all is well, run 'make install'

    Things will install in /usr/local.  If you'd like to use a different
    prefix, use 'make PREFIX=/your/path install'.
