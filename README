Postcard

    I always like to hear from people who use conserver - it's exciting
    to see how many people all over the world are using the package.
    If you'd like to give me a real thrill, send me a postcard of your
    site, town, or area!  Even if you're right around the corner, it
    would be a blast to hear from you.
