Mailing Lists

    There are currently two mailing lists available at conserver.com.
    announce@conserver.com is an announcement-only mailing list for
    informing of new versions, major developments, etc.
    users@conserver.com is for general Q&A, discussions, ideas, etc for
    conserver users.  See http://www.conserver.com/ for pointers to
    these and possibly future lists.


Origin

    The console server software found here is a heavily modified
    version originally written by Tom Fine (fine@cis.ohio-state.edu)
    and then Kevin S Braunsdorf (ksb+conserver@sa.fedex.com).  Patches
    from Robert Olson (olson@mcs.anl.gov) were then applied to get
    network console support.

    Arnold de Leon (arnold@corp.webtv.net) then fixed various bugs and
    added enhancements while at Synopsys.  I then took the result and
    continued fixing things and adding features we found useful.
    Certainty Solutions has been supporting my coding efforts (in too
    many ways to list) since 1996.


The conserver.com Distribution

    The result is a combination of many people's work.  This version is
    being released in hopes that it will help others.  There is no
    warranty or support implied by the distribution of the software.

    As of version 6.1.7, the packaging and numbering sheme has
    changed.  I used to package conserver as conserver-GNAC-v.vv.
    Since GNAC (now Certainty Solutions) has changed it's name I've
    decided to drop the GNAC portion and use a 3 digit version number
    (conserver-v.v.v).  Why change the version numbering?  I need to
    differenciate this thread of the code from the original authors and
    I couldn't come up with a good replacement for the GNAC name - sad,
    but true.


Downloading

Other Good Information

    Zonker Harris has fabulous documents regarding the hookup
    of consoles to terminal servers and other such devices.  His
    Greater Scroll of Console Knowledge is a great place to start
    (http://www.conserver.com/consoles/).
