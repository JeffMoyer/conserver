Warning to those who aren't me: this is an unorganized list of things
that might be classified as bugs, improvements, random thoughts or
suggestions.  Hopefully it will get cleaned up over time.

---------------------------------------------------------------------------

- Telnet protocol should be improved
    - Not even RFC 854 compliant
    - Data sent to terminal server not encapsulated
    - Option negotiation ignored - should we negotiate anything?
    - Others?

- reread of conserver.cf - totally difficult
    - non-dynamic memory allocation
    - no IPC for coordinated updates
    - additions only may work
    - deletions only may work
    - reimplement the whole thing *would* work

- better shadow file support

- PAM support

- syslog?

- alternate (md5) password encryption support in conserver.passwd

- config file examples for various configurations

- per-line timestamps
    - only when not connected?

- flow control configuration (hardcoded on, i think)

- pipe input/output (console <-> program) via 'console'

- group permissions (better user management in general)

- 64-bit compilation support (have a patch set contributed, somewhere, i think)

- autologout?  setting per console?  gack, would have to interpret data.

- "listen" capability (watch all/multiple consoles)

- alternate break (^ecl2?)

- aliases for console entries

- authentication to terminal servers (ssh, passphrase, whatever)

- "not" or "except" in passwd file (!console).

- multi-homed/multi-ip hosts not supported well
    - other names/ip addrs not detected as local, necessarily
    - acls don't look at aliases properly
    - the whole thing needs some serious help

- cyclades ts1000/2000 port : "Moses, Joel" <jmoses@deloitte.com>

- dynamic memory allocation
    - buf[BUFSIZ] in conserver/group.c CheckPasswd().
    - kill --with-maxgrp

- config file for client (list of masters, for example)

- strftime() idea for logfile names : Lars Kellogg-Stedman <lars@larsshack.org>

- 9600baud log replay?

- SSH/SSL/Encryption of some type between client/server

- server -M flag should accept multiple addresses (comma separated)
    - should client as well?

- logfile rotation based on size

- website docs on serial port configs
    - PCs (solaris x86, linux, *bsd, etc)
    - lilo
    - bios support
