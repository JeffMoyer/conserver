Warning to those who aren't me: this is an unorganized list of things
that might be classified as bugs, improvements, random thoughts or
suggestions.  Hopefully it will get cleaned up over time (yeah,
right!).

---------------------------------------------------------------------------

- checks for EPIPE during write() should really be done, but, for the
  most part, consoles and clients will come around and we'll see
  problems on the read().

- Singular logging so that swatch/logsurfer can watch for errors across
  the board - unloved output comes close

- Telnet protocol should be improved
    - Not even RFC 854 compliant
    - Option negotiation ignored - should we negotiate anything?
    - Others?

- better shadow file support

- PAM support

- syslog?
    Daniel E. Singer <des@cs.duke.edu> would like to see it - especially
    in regards to --use-libwrap code

- alternate (md5) password encryption support in conserver.passwd

- config file examples for various configurations

- per-line timestamps
    - only when not connected?

- flow control configuration (hardcoded on, i think)

- pipe input/output (console <-> program) via 'console'
    - some apps (net-ups thing, gdb) might need to talk to user

- group permissions (better user management in general)

- 64-bit compilation support (have a patch set contributed, somewhere, i think)

- autologout?  setting per console?  gack, would have to interpret data.

- "listen" capability (watch all/multiple consoles)

- break sequences - need .5 second delays (or delays in general?)

- aliases for console entries

- authentication to terminal servers (ssh, passphrase, whatever)

- "not" or "except" in passwd file (!console).

- multi-homed/multi-ip hosts not supported well
    - other names/ip addrs not detected as local, necessarily
    - acls don't look at aliases properly
    - the whole thing needs some serious help

- cyclades ts1000/2000 port : "Moses, Joel" <jmoses@deloitte.com>

- config file for client (list of masters, for example)

- strftime() idea for logfile names : Lars Kellogg-Stedman <lars@larsshack.org>

- 9600baud log replay?

- SSH/SSL/Encryption of some type between client/server

- server -M flag should accept multiple addresses (comma separated)
    - should client as well?

- logfile rotation based on size

- automatic log rotation in general : Egan Ford <egan@us.ibm.com>

- website docs on serial port configs
    - PCs (solaris x86, linux, *bsd, etc)
    - lilo
    - bios support

- suggestions by Trevor Fiatal <trevor@seven.com>
    - include server hostname on 'console -x' output
    - non-interactively be able to
	- disconnect a single user-to-port session
	- disconnect all sessions to a given port
	- disconnect all sessions registered to a particular user
    - non-interactively be able to send messages to
	- all sessions open by a particular user
	  console -t user "Time to go home."
	- a particular user-session
	  console -t user@managed-host "Please disconnect from this host."
	- all users on a given host
	  console -t @managed-host "I am taking over this host."

- support 2 stop bits (as well as other stty-type options in console
  definitions) : Kelly Setzer <setzer@placemark.com>

- ability to configure strings to be sent to a console whenever it is
  (re)opened (eg. a termserver login) : Greg A. Woods
  <woods@planix.com>

- ability to configure strings to be sent to a console periodically :
  Greg A. Woods <woods@planix.com>

- show attach/detach events to/of spy console clients : Greg A. Woods
  <woods@planix.com>
