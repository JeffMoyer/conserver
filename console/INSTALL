Prep:

 Did you do the prep work in ../conserver yet?  If not please start there.


Compiling:

 Try a
	make
 in this directory.  If cons.h is correct this should just compile.


First test:

 Run a version command:
	./console -V
 and see something like:
	console: $Id: INSTALL,v 4.1 91/06/19 15:27:49 ksb Exp $
	console: initial master server `staff.cc.purdue.edu'
	console: default escape sequence `^Ec'
	console: loopback address for mentor.cc.purdue.edu is 127.0.0.1


 Finish the INSTALL in conserver now.


Connect to the conserver on your dumb port,

 Try all the commands.  Especially ^Ecz and ^Ecd/^Eco.

 Try two connections to the same console, note the cool way you can force
 the other guy off (^Ecf).
