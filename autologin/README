I have not touched the autologin directory.  See the README.old and
INSTALL.old files if you interested in the program.  I cannot guarantee
it will compile, install, or run.  It is definately not integrated with
../Makefile or any of the porting support.  If you have patches that
make it work, please send them to me and I'll be more than happy to
incorporate them.

No one I've ever talked to found a need for something like autologin.
Good luck.
