				=======

version 7.0.3 (Jul 5, 2001):
	- "Off by 1" bug in 7.0.2 line-oriented timestamp code fixed (extra
	  chars in logfile) reported by Matthew Cheek <cheek@mars-systems.com>
	- TODO file added to distribution

	- gethostbyaddr() failures are no longer fatal
	- Added -M for server to specify the address to listen on

	    - Added --with-logfile to configure
	    - Added -L to override compile-time logfile location

	- Hostname not passed with username from console client
	- Fixed pseudo-terminal ('|' syntax in .cf file) bug with Solaris
	  and other STREAMS-based systems (actually works now in 7.X)
	- Line-oriented timestamps in logfiles (see 'l' mark
	  specification) based on patch from Benn Oshrin
	  <benno@columbia.edu>
	- Generalized debugging output, info messages and error messages

	  <fenner@research.att.com>
	- PID file patch by Martin Andrews <mandrews@netgenics.com>

version 7.0.0 (Feb 18, 2001):
	- GNU configure-based packaging!!!
	  All work done by Mark D. Roth <roth@feep.net>.
	  Thank you!
	- Removed conserver/cons.h and moved options into --with
	  and --enable configure arguments
	- ioctl() bug found by Ross Parker <parker@redback.com>
	- Removed last of the "loopback preference" code in
	  console/console.c - should have been removed a long time ago

version 6.1.7 (Dec 14, 2000):
	- Documented no parity option in conserver.cf.man
	- Lowered default CONNECTTIMEOUT to 10 seconds
	- Changed more internal references to GNAC
	- Shell command support just plain broken (tracked down and
	  slain by Rob Joyce <robjoyce@ee.princeton.edu>)
	- Added a -P option for specifying the password file
	- CPARITY setting reflected in -V output
	- New version numbering scheme and packaging

version 6.16 (Sep 8, 2000):
	- Changed the main GNAC references to Certainty Solutions
	- Made the comment blocks in conserver/cons.h a little less
	  confusing
	- There are *NO* code changes to this version.  If you have
	  version 6.15, you're good to go.

version 6.15 (Mar 6, 2000):
	- Added debug flag (-D) and the beginning of debug output
	- A timeout can now be set for TCP connect() calls.  The
	  default is 30 seconds.  Hosts not responding are only
	  tried once at startup (per child), lessening the impact
	  of a down terminal server.  See CONNECTTIMEOUT in
	  conserver/cons.h.

version 6.14 (Jan 5, 2000):
	- Determining if the local conserver controls a port (with
	  @conserver spec) we now compare ip addresses instead of
	  hostnames
	- Invalid argument now shows -h output

version 6.13 (Dec 1, 1999):
	- High-bit always stripped from network - now follows
	  CPARITY setting in cons.h (found by Daniel Andersson
	  <daniel@sto.sema.se>)
	- New conserver -i flag for on-demand connects/disconnects
	  to console ports (contributed by Thomas E. Knowles
	  <tek@CS.Princeton.EDU>)
	- Solaris, Linux, and others now use tcsendbreak()

version 6.12 (Aug 24, 1999):
	- Blank line bug after '%%' in .cf file (found by Miss
	  Himali Patel <cpate03@dcs.bbk.ac.uk>)
     Special thanks to Michael Sullivan <mike@trdlnk.com> for
     the following improvements and fixes...
	- Read result bug in group.c caused lock up
	- Signal handling fixes and cleanup
	- Several minor spelling errors in strings and comments
	- Solaris package creation scripts (contrib/solaris-package)
	- Extended syntax of the access restrictions to understand
	  network numbers with optional netmasks

version 6.11 (May 14, 1999):
	- Added broadcast capability in client (-b option)
	- Protected certain escape sequences from end-user use
	- Added "console server shutting down" broadcast
	- Improved local tty break code (thanks Craig and Brian!)

version 6.10 (Jan 26, 1999):
	- Documentation fixes
	- Web page up and running

version 6.09:
	- Added more documentation (look for README and INSTALL files).
	- Fixed up man pages so they are more accurate.

version 6.08:
	- Added support for Linux 2.X and IRIX 6.X
	- Fixed "suspend" code in client - it shouldn't have worked
	  before, but slow connections could explain it.

version 6.07:
	- Porting infrastructure has been set up in ./port.  Solaris
	  2.5.1 and BSD/OS 3.1 successfully built.
	- Added CHANGES and README files.  Wow, starting to document!

version 6.06:
	- SIGUSR1 now tells the console server to try and reopen all
	  currently downed consoles.
	- Cleaned up configuration file (cons.h) and Makefiles.

version 6.05:
	- conserver.cf change: groups and their passwords have been
	  removed and timestamp specifications have been added.

before version 6.05:
	- Many, many variations.  Nothing was tracked well.  Bug fixes
	  and enhancements of various types were applied.
