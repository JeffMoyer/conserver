				=======

	  2.5.1 and BSD/OS 3.1 successfully built.

	  currently downed consoles.
	- Cleaned up configuration file (cons.h) and Makefiles.

version 6.05:
	- conserver.cf change: groups and their passwords have been
	  removed and timestamp specifications have been added.

before version 6.05:
	- Many, many variations.  Nothing was tracked well.  Bug fixes
	  and enhancements of various types were applied.
